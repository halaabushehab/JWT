# JWT


### I will develop an authentication system using Node.js with in-memory storage for temporary user data and JWT for sign-up and sign-in. The token will be stored in cookies, and middleware will be implemented to protect the profile page, ensuring only authenticated users can access it. Upon successful login, users will be redirected to the home page.
